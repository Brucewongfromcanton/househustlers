# House Hustlers

Our group - **House Hustlers**, has been working on a machine model aimed to leverage historical housing market data and population datasets to predict future trends and fluctuations in the real estate market in the **City of Boroondara**. 

This is a **Python mahcine learning program** using *pandas*, *scikit-learn* & *matplotlib*. By Analysing key variables such as property prices, demographic shifts, and population growth patterns, this program seeks to provide valuable insight for stakeholders, including potential homebuyers, investors, and policy makers. 

The ultimate goal is to forecast future changes in the housing market, helping to inform strategic decisions and improve planning in the real estate industry.

## Analysis:
1. Price Trends: We can analyze how the median house and unit prices have changed over the years.
2. Sales Volume Trends: The counts of sales for houses and units (cBuy_House, cBuy_Unit) over the years can reveal market demand.
3. Rental Trends: We can analyze rental demand and price trends for both houses and units.

## Prediction:
1. Price Prediction: Predict future median house and unit prices (mBuy_House, mBuy_Unit) based on historical trends.
2. Sales Volume Prediction: Predict future counts of house and unit sales (cBuy_House, cBuy_Unit) based on historical data.
3. Rent Prediction: Once the missing values are handled, we can predict future rental prices and rental counts.
