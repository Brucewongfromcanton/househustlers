# House Hustlers

Our group - **House Hustlers**, has been working on a machine model aimed to leverage historical housing market data and population datasets to predict future trends and fluctuations in the real estate market in the **City of Boroondara**. 

This is a **Python mahcine learning program** using *pandas*, *scikit-learn* & *matplotlib*. By Analysing key variables such as property prices, demographic shifts, and population growth patterns, this program seeks to provide valuable insight for stakeholders, including potential homebuyers, investors, and policy makers. 

The ultimate goal is to forecast future changes in the housing market, helping to inform strategic decisions and improve planning in the real estate industry.

## Datasets:
- **Housing_Data.csv:** This contains the historical housing data (house prices, rents, sales volumes, etc.) for the City of Boroondara.
- **Forecast_Pop_By_Area.csv:** This contains the forecast population data for the City of Boroondara.
Make sure these files are correctly named and placed in the root of the project directory.

## Model Training:
The models used in this project are **Linear Regression**, **KNN Regressor**, and **Decision Tree Regressor**. Each model is trained on the Year feature, and predictions are made for future years (up to 2028).

### Model Parameters
The following parameters can be customized directly in the scripts:

- **Year Range**: You can adjust the year range for predictions in the scripts (up to 2028).
- **Population Data**: The population data is already limited to 2021, 2026, and 2031. You can extend this based on additional data, if available.
- **Neighbours for KNN**: In the KNN model, the number of neighbours is automatically chosen based on the dataset size, but this can be adjusted manually.

## Prediction Guide

Once the models are trained, you can use them to make predictions for future house prices, rents, and sales volumes. The following steps guide you through the prediction process:

1. **Predict Future Housing Prices and Volumes**:
   After running the respective model script, predictions for future years (up to 2028) will be made automatically. The predicted house prices and volumes are plotted against historical data and population growth.

2. **Predict Rental Prices and Volumes**:
   Similarly, predictions for rental prices and sales volumes will be generated by the scripts. Visualisations are also created for a comprehensive comparison.

### Example Prediction Output:
Upon running a model script, you will see the following:
- **RMSE and MAE Metrics**: The script prints out the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for the predictions.
- **Graphs**: You will see plots comparing predicted house prices, rents, or sales volumes with historical data and population growth trends.
