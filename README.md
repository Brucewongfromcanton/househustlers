# House Hustlers
Python program using pandas, scikit-learn & matplotlib

## Analysis Potential:
1. Price Trends: We can analyze how the median house and unit prices have changed over the years.
2. Sales Volume Trends: The counts of sales for houses and units (cBuy_House, cBuy_Unit) over the years can reveal market demand.
3. Rental Trends: We can analyze rental demand and price trends for both houses and units.

## Prediction Potential:
1. Price Prediction: Predict future median house and unit prices (mBuy_House, mBuy_Unit) based on historical trends.
2. Sales Volume Prediction: Predict future counts of house and unit sales (cBuy_House, cBuy_Unit) based on historical data.
3. Rent Prediction: Once the missing values are handled, we can predict future rental prices and rental counts.
